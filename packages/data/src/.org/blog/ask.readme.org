#+TITLE: README: Ask Jeeves Brainstorming

* What should we ask Jeeves?

** What should I do today?

Jonah had an idea about being lazy and having Jeeves plan your day. There are some cool APIs out there:

*** Events

- API with a huge list of events! 

https://www.eventbrite.com/d/tx--austin/events--today/

- API for movies playing near me?
- Include Rotten Tomatoes API for reviews?

*** Authentication to allow user to set preferences, get better results over time


** GraphQL APIs
