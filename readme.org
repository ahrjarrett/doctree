** Amplify CLI

Assuming your IAM user is created and the Amplify CLI is installed:

- New project:
  =amplify init=
- Make =aws-exports.js=, build all your local backend resources & provision it
  =amplify push=
- Deploy:
  =amplify publish=
  - Creates an S3 bucket in our account and uses Route 53 for hosting
- Status, get URL
  =amplify status=

  
*** Route 53
- New hosting:
  =amplify add hosting=

  
**** Hosted Zones

"A hosted zone is a container for records, and records contain information about how you want to route traffic for a specific domain, such as example.com, and its subdomains (acme.example.com, zenith.example.com). A hosted zone and the corresponding domain have the same name." [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/hosted-zones-working-with.html][Route 53 Docs on Hosted Zones]]

- When you register a domain with Route 53, we create a hosted zone for you automatically.

- In both cases, you then create records in the hosted zone to specify how you want to route traffic for the domain and subdomains. [[https://docs.aws.amazon.com/Route53/latest/DeveloperGuide/AboutHZWorkingWith.html][Working with Records]]





*** CloudFront
To update your hosting to use (or not use) CloudFront run:

=amplify configure hosting=
