** Amplify CLI

Assuming your IAM user is created and the Amplify CLI is installed:

- New project:
  =amplify init=
- New hosting:
  =amplify add hosting=
- Get =aws-exports.js= file (sync Amplify with our project?)
- Deploy:
  =amplify publish=
  - Creates an S3 bucket in our account and uses Route 53 for hosting (I think?).


*** CloudFront
To update your hosting to use CloudFront run:

=amplify configure hosting=
